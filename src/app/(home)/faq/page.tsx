					<p>
						We will have <strong className="font-semibold text-gray-50">two</strong>{" "}
						30-minute phone consultations. The first 30-minute phone
						consultation is for me to get to know you, your personality and your
						dating goals. Based on this information, I will review your current
						dating profile and deliver a completely custom profile that
						includes:
					</p>
					<ul className="list-disc my-2">
						<li>
							Selecting and strategically placing the most attractive pictures
							of you
						</li>
						<li>Writing a witty bio that will attract in your ideal match</li>
						<li>
							Choose written prompts that will have women messaging you first
						</li>
					</ul>

					<p>
						The second 30-minute phone consult is a 1-month follow up to discuss
						the results your new profile edits. We can also tweak a few things
						if needed. Ultimately, this is YOUR time and you'll be able to ask
						and discuss relevant topics.

					get started. I'll also send you a follow up message after the review
					to let you know if I've made any changes to your profile.
				</p>

					tweaks we can make. I will also add on another 1 month follow up if
