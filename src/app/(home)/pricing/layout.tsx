								pictures of you

								- Writing a witty bio that will attract in your ideal match
							</li>
							<li>
								- Choose written prompts that will have women messaging you
								first
							</li>
						</ul>

						<p>
							The second 30-minute phone consult is a 1-month follow up to
							discuss the results your new profile edits. We can also tweak a
							few things if needed. Ultimately, this is YOUR time and you'll be
							able to ask and discuss relevant topics.
