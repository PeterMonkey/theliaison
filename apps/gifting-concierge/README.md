- [x] Not a button, but clickable “How it works” underneath the “choose a gift” button.
- [x] Nothing else on this page. Please move everything over to the “How it works” page.
- [ ] Let's change "Choose Gift" to "What would you like to send?" and then 3 options appear... (our gift shop, a unique link or a custom gift).
- [ ] Also "How it works" doesn't have to be a button.
Notes: Only other thing should be a chat bot bubble on the right bottom corner and the footer.
