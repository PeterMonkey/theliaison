(Docs)[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1E9wbSQpK_ZvKMGJZokJBJuvEx12kzk2TIFQm8Ze5pLg/edit?usp=sharing]
- [ ] Add a FAQ page

Home Page:
- [x] Let’s make “Secure and private gifting.” bold and have the animated shine effect on the “Made easy.”
- [x] “Gift effortlessly, surprise instantly” on one line. “No address needed” underneath.
- [x] Button: “Choose a gift”
- [x] Not a button, but clickable “How it works” underneath the “choose a gift” button.
- [x] Nothing else on this page. Please move everything over to the “How it works” page.
- [x] Let's change "Choose Gift" to "What would you like to send?" and then 3 options appear... (our gift shop, a unique link or a custom gift).
- [x] Also "How it works" doesn't have to be a button.
- [x] remove capitaization
- [x] Also, I don't think this "How it works" needs to be a button. Just the words hyperlinked
- [x] Sure let's see it. Also, remove the ">"
Notes: Only other thing should be a chat bot bubble on the right bottom corner and the footer.

Footer:
- [x] put some on rotation or on different pages at the bottom of each page.
